Model Driven Data Center Automation

Compiling this project requires you to install stack

I haven't provided documentation (yet) on the syntax of the configuration language. You can learn it by looking at the two example configuration files and by looking at the parser.

I am rewriting this code to add features and to clean up the data structures, etc.  This was/is a prototype that took less than a week to write, so it is not really production ready, though, it works quite nicely.

Please feel free to contact me - shlomobauer gmail com - fill in the dots (not that I am really fooling any program scraping email addresses).
